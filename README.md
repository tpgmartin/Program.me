# Program.me

## Overview

### Description

This repo constitutes my final project for the December 2013 - March 2014
intake of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course.

Program.me is designed to be a secure platform to allow lesson scheduling and communication between tutors, students and parents.

The site is built around a simple, easy to use calendar.

Users are allowed to signup as a parent, student, or tutor. Tutors are provided a unique key, which they are to give to their students in order for them to connect on the site.
